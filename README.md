# microK8s
This repository provides guidelines obtaining all best practices for deploying
and managing microservices applications in a Kubernetes environment

### **Step-by-step plan:**
**Step 1. Audit of the microservices architecture and design**
1. **Analyze Microservices Architecture**
   - Ensure each microservice has a clearly defined purpose and scope.
   - Analyze dependencies between services to identify communication patterns.

2. **Evaluate State Management**
   - Determine how each service manages its state (e.g., stateless, stateful).
   - For stateful services, consider Kubernetes stateful sets or use cloud resources to host such workloads (e.g. Databases).

3. **Assess Scalability and Resource Requirements**
   - Estimate resource needs (CPU, memory) for each service under various loads.
   - Plan for horizontal scaling (adding more instances) or vertical scaling (adding more resources per instance).

4. **Define Configuration and Secrets Management**
   - Identify configuration and secret data. Use ConfigMaps for configuration data and Secrets for sensitive data in K8s.

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Identify security requirements and compliance constraints.
   - Plan to implement necessary security measures like network policies and RBAC.

**Step 2. Containerize Microservices**
1. **Create Dockerfiles**
   - Write Dockerfiles for each microservice, ensuring efficient layer caching and minimal image size.
   - Use multi-stage builds to separate build environments from runtime environments.

2. **Build and Test Containers**
   - Build Docker images and run containers locally to test.
   - Use tools like Docker Compose to simulate multi-service interaction.

**Step 3. Prepare Kubernetes Environment**
1. **Choose a Managed Kubernetes Provider**
   - Compare offerings (Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service, Amazon EKS) based on features, cost, and support.W

2. **Set up Cluster**
   - Provision the cluster with required compute resources.
   - Configure networking, including load balancers, ingress controllers, and service meshes if needed.

3. **Define Deployment Specifications**
   - Create YAML manifests for deployments, services, and other necessary resources.
   - Use Helm charts for templating and managing Kubernetes resources.

**Step 4. Set up Monitoring and Logging**
1. **Implement Monitoring Tools**
   - Deploy monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana to track the health and performance of services.
   - Set up alerts based on metrics thresholds.

2. **Set Up Logging**
   - Use centralized logging solutions like Elasticsearch, Logstash (Fluentd), and Kibana (ELK) stack.
   - Ensure logs are collected, stored, and searchable for debugging and analysis.

**Step 5. CI/CD Integration**
1. **Setup Continuous Integration**
   - Use CI tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to automate testing and building of Docker images.
   - Integrate security scans and quality checks into the CI pipeline.

2. **SetupContinuous Deployment**
   - Automate deployment to Kubernetes using CI/CD pipelines (e.g. use ArgoCD).
   - Implement rolling updates or blue-green deployment strategies to minimize downtime.

**Step 6. Disaster Recovery and Data Backup**
1. **Plan for Failover and Recovery**
   - Implement backup strategies for data persistence layers.
   - Design failover mechanisms to handle node or zone failures within the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Regular Testing**
   - Regularly test backup and recovery processes to ensure they work as expected.

**Step 7. Optimization and Cost Management**
1. Resource Optimization**
   - Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale services based on load.
   - Optimize resource requests and limits to balance performance and cost.

2. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Monitor and analyze costs associated with the managed Kubernetes services.
   - Utilize cost management tools provided by cloud providers to forecast and reduce expenses.
